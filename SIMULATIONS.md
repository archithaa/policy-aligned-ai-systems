# Chat Simulations

This repository includes 10 realistic chat simulations based on actual low-rated user complaints.

The simulations cover:
- accidental orders and cancellation fees
- wrong or missing items
- food quality issues
- Instamart return disputes
- app glitches blocking complaints
- delivery batching delays
- incorrect billing

Each simulation demonstrates:
- issue extraction,
- factual verification via logs,
- calm de-escalation,
- and resolution with minimal refund usage.

The goal is not to “win the argument”, but to resolve the issue in a way that is fair, explainable, and scalable.
