# Design Thinking & Decision Framework

## Problem Framing

Customer support is a decision problem under uncertainty.

Each interaction requires balancing:
- user emotion,
- factual logs,
- platform policy,
- financial impact,
- and long-term trust.

## Key Design Principles

1. Policy first, empathy always  
2. Refunds as last resort, not default , except under exceptional circumstances.
3. Transparency as a de-escalation tool

## Decision Ladder

Issues are resolved using a four-level ladder:
- Level 0: Clarification only
- Level 1: Small goodwill credit
- Level 2: Strong credit & internal escalation
- Level 3: Full refund (strictly policy-aligned)

The system always chooses the lowest fair level.

## Non-Monetary Resolution Strategies

Before offering money, the AI attempts:
- clear explanation using logs,
- fixing future friction (address, payment, batching),
- internal quality flags,
- priority handling for retention-critical users.

These techniques reduce refund dependency while increasing perceived fairness.
