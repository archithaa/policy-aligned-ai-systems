# Executive Summary

This project was developed as a response to a Founder’s Office–style problem:
how to design an AI system that can independently handle high-volume, high-emotion customer interactions without defaulting to refunds.

The primary objective was to reduce refund outflow while maintaining or improving user trust.

Key constraints considered:
- Marketplace liability boundaries
- Terms & Conditions compliance
- Cost of over-refunding at scale
- Risk of abuse vs genuine customer dissatisfaction

The resulting system does not treat refunds as the primary solution. Instead, it uses:
- structured issue diagnosis,
- non-monetary resolution pathways,
- selective goodwill credits,
- and strict policy alignment.

This reflects real-world decision-making required in fast-growing platforms where AI systems increasingly replace human judgment at scale.
